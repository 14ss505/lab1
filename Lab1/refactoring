1.若兄弟类之间有相同的方法和属性，将方法和属性提升到了父类中
2.增加了setDescription方法，便于在运行时修改description

3.use the factory pattern and move the if-else into the BeverageFactory class,this will make refix the code become easier
and if we have some changes in beverage we can just modify the code in BeverageFactory
4.use decorator pattern,let the class Beverage,BeverageWithIngredient,CoffeeBeverage,TeaBeverage become abstract class
so the subclass must have the abstract method defined in super class,and we can make an order by wrapping it in another
class,just like "new Milk(Decaf)"
5.move the test classes into another package test and add a TestAll class to do all the test at the same time.
